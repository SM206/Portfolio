A Proposal from Heaven

Haha… Don’t you feel ashamed to be a plus-size girl? Just look at your body—thighs, hips, belly, breasts, stomach, even your face. Don’t you feel heavy? Bro, leave her fat. Look at her hair growth. The facial hair makes her look like a bulky man. Did you see her acne, pigmentation, pimples—who says she is high maintenance? Everything else might be fair, but just look at her skin color. She thinks she is in her Brown Aura… even a cow shines better than her. Ooh, today is Propose Day, right? Did anyone propose? Haha…!!

I silently listened to what my ex and his best friend said. I cried quietly, thinking he would stop, but I hardly expected such cruelty from a human. I tried to cheer myself up, but I felt sorry for myself. On the side of the road, I started crying while he laughed.

To make my inner self strong, I wiped my tears and began walking home. The whole street, I complained to God: “Why me? Why is it always me?” Then I saw a temple. Luckily, there were no humans inside. I fell to God’s feet, crying so hard that words couldn’t come out.

As I lifted my head to look at God and start my complaint, a flower fell from above, landing on my head. Wait… What? Did God just bless me… or propose to me? Tears streamed down my face as gratitude overflowed. I bowed again, and a full garland fell around my neck.
As I looked up, crying and smiling, I felt God nod and shake His eyebrows playfully. In that moment, I realized I had received the best proposal—directly from Heaven. I titled myself: “God’s Favorite Child.”

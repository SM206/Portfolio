It's God's Plan

From “Hey, let’s go to the club and dance,”
To “Hmm… sorry, today there’s no chance.”
From enjoying orange in sunsets of bliss,
To loving blue in oceans of peace.

Tired of crying in regrets and hope,
Now only believing in God’s scope.
Even this bad time is teaching a lesson,
Monkey mind, please stop the endless question.

Maybe my past karma plays the main character,
So let’s just walk and run through this chapter.
Trust me, God holds the distant light,
Like the sky cradles stars at night.

Take a breath in — and run now yourself,
Society will be shocked themselves.
Look around, everyone’s someone’s fan,
But I just believe — it’s God’s perfect plan.

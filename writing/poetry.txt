Chained in Gold, Broken in Silence

Waking up without closing an eye,
Smiling like a puppet, living a lie.
Living in a house called 'Pari Nivas',
And treated like a devil child of class.
Carrying a bag of responsibilities,
Drowning beneath unseen liabilities.
Wearing the family's reputation,
Etched in the name of bound expectation.
Tying a rope of family pride,
They only loved me when I was the bride.
Blushing my cheeks with my husband's slaps,
And covering my burned hair with colorful caps.
Eating the leftover food like cow,
And you will be asking, You are living, how?
Exploring my karma day by day,
Still searching for a shining ray.
